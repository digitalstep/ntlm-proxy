ntlm-proxy
==========
A very simple proxy server, written in Java.

I created this little proxy in order to get Maven working behind an annoying corporate firewall.

Download binary from the wiki page.

Usage: java -jar ntlm-proxy-0.1.0.jar 1234

the 1234 is the port the proxy server ist listening on. Just change it to your like.

Based on code an information found in
